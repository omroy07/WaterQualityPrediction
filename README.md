# ðŸŒŠ Water Quality Prediction

Predict water potability using machine learning based on physicochemical parameters.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project employs machine learning to **predict whether water is potable** using features like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity. Useful for water safety assessments and resource planning.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- Data handling: `pandas`, `numpy`  
- Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- ML models: `scikit-learn` (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- (Optional) Web app: `Flask` or `Streamlit`
